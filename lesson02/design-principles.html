        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>

        <p>
          VS Code's homepage uses visual hierarchy to direct its audience. The
          heading of <em>"Code editing. Redefined."</em> is most prominent, with
          the download button highlighted below it. There is also only a single
          download button shown, instead of all download options, which is a
          good example of Hick's law. The reader then looks to the top and sees
          the newest version of the software, and below the download button, a
          screenshot of the application. Other features are emphasized lower
          down, such as Intellisense and Extensions.

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <a
          href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software"
        >
          Microsoft Teams
        </a>
        <img src="images/ms_teams.jpg" alt="MS Teams screenshot" />
        <p>
          The Teams homepage has a very bright, clean, open design. It is very
          minimal with a short header, two buttons, and an image. There is also
          a notification banner at the top of the page. In this top section of
          the page, there are no large blocks of text. There is a large
          whitespace before the next section where the longer text begins. The
          space is very well used on the page, and it gives a good first
          impression to the reader of the simplicity of the software.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
        <img src="images/github.jpg" alt="GitHub screenshot" />
        <p>
          The GitHub homepage has a great level of contrast with a white heading
          on top of a dark background image. Below it is a faded subtext that,
          because of it's low contrast, will likely be read last. Instead,
          readers' eyes will be drawn to the email input box. The green button
          also stands out well and is a good call-to-action button. Contrast is
          used to separate the header from the main content of the page. On a
          side note, for mobile screens the email input and sign-up button are
          in a very accessible position.
