      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Chill Earth is targeted at a wide range of people (teens to adults) who
        enjoy outdoor activities and want to stay updated on good activities for
        the current weather.
      </p>
      <h3>Personas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Taylor (16) loves outdoor sports and usually takes charge of planning
          activities with his friends. He's looking for some new ideas for
          activities to plan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jane (24) is fascinated by extreme weather. She loves lightning storms
          and blizzards. She wants a website that can help her find some good
          storms to enjoy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Scenarios</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Taylor and his buddies are going snowboarding. He wants to plan ahead,
          so he checks Chill Earth for the weather conditions at his favorite
          snowboarding resort.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jane wants to spend a weekend on the beach in California. She checks
          Chill Earth to see when the next storm is so she can plan a good time
          for beach combing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taylor is in the mood for a bike ride up the canyon, but it's been a
          hot week. Luckily, Chill Earth shows that there's a good cloudy day
          later in the week.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jane's crush seems like boyfriend material and she wants to ask him on
          a date. It's winter in Rexburg, so she looks up the next blizzard on
          Chill Earth, which would conveniently give her a good excuse to
          snuggle up with her boy and drink some hot choccy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taylor is a pretty good disc golfer and he's looking for a way to
          challenge himself. Chill Earth has some good recommendations for disc
          golf courses that typically have high winds.
